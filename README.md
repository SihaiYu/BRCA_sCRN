Preparatory Work
============================================================
To begin with, installing the Python simulator for sCRNs is required to complete this simulation task.

The Python simulator for sCRNs is developed by Samuel Clamons, et. al., and you can obtain it from [Surface_CRNs](https://github.com/sclamons/surface_crns) which provides a detailed description of how to use the simulator.


Simulation of Binary Reaction Cellular Automaton (BRCA) on surface Chemical Reaction Networks (sCRNs)
============================================================
This package contains the configuration files related to the Sihai Yu, Wenli Xu, Jia Lee and Teijiro Isokawa "A Cellular Automaton Approach for Efficient Computing on Surface Chemical Reaction Networks".

After successfully installing the sCRNs Python simulator as required, place these configuration files along with [run_this.py](https://github.com/SihaiYu/BRCA_sCRN/blob/main/A_Cellular_Automaton_Approach_for_Efficient_Computing_on_Surface_Chemical_Reaction_Networks_0603/run_this.py) in the same folder and run it.
