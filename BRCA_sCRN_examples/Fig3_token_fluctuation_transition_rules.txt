# Logic circuit rule set optimized for readability and, to a lesser extent,
#   compressed physical layout.
# Gates lock during computation, allowing sequential gate logic.
#
# A 46-rule, compressed variant using only NOR gates is included in
# Box5-logic_circuit_transition_rules_compressed.txt

### WIRE RULES
### 1 rules, 2 species
